# hexo-bubble

A Hexo tag plugin to format text into chat-like speech bubbles. A work in progress.

## Installation

```
npm i hexo-bubble --save
```

## Usage

Place `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hexo-bubble@latest/src/css/bubble.min.css">` at the *beginning* of your post or *directly under* your `<!-- more -->` if the tag is being used there.

### Syntax

```markdown
{% bubble [Character] [attribute] %}
  You can use *Markdown* in the text.

  <thought>Wrap around thought bubbles with these tags to give the text a blue color!</thought>

  Have special character endings and don't want them to be cut-off by word wrapping? Use these tags to make sure it stays attached to the last <hold>word☆</hold>
{% endbubble %}
```

- `[Character]`: Charater name. No spaces within the name.
- `[attribute]`: **Optional.** Special styling for the bubbles if the character is off-screen (hidden) or unknown (but the reader knows who they are). Available options are `unknown` and `hidden`. It must be *lowercase*.
- `<thought></thought`, `<th></th>`: Special tag to wrap around thoughts. It's in a blue color.
- `<hold></hold>`, `<ho></ho>`: Special tag to prevent special characters being cut-off by word wrap.

### Options

To use a specific series' css file for styling, insert `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hexo-bubble@latest/src/css/{series}.min.css">` at the *beginning* of your post or *directly under* your `<!-- more -->` if the tag is being used there. Complete series css files are `enst` (Ensemble Stars) and `pjsk` (Project Sekai).

`enst.css` has a special font for Natsume's spells. Use the `<spell></spell>` or `<sp></sp>` tags to activate it!

## Customization

It's possible to use your own css for the variables. Just follow the format below.

```css
[character="NAME"][attribute] {
  --color: COLOR;
  --light-mode: COLOR;
  --icon: url("URL");
}
```
